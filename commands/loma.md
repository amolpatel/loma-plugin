# Loma - Living Organized Memory Architecture

Loma is an AI-persistent project knowledge system that maintains alignment across coding sessions spanning weeks or months.

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/loma:init` | Initialize `loma/` structure in a new project |
| `/loma:audit` | Audit existing `loma/` for correctness and currency |
| `/loma:handover` | Create session handover document for continuity |
| `/loma:update-map` | Regenerate `loma-map.md` index from current files |
| `/loma:maintain` | Run weekly maintenance checklist |

## Quick Start

1. **New project?** Run `/loma:init` to create the folder structure
2. **Existing project?** Run `/loma:audit` to verify documentation health
3. **End of session?** Run `/loma:handover` to capture state for next time

## Core Philosophy

- **Human**: Owns the code, makes final decisions
- **AI**: Memory keeper and high-speed executor
- **Golden Rule**: Anything worth implementing is worth permanently recording in the Loma
